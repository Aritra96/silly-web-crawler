# Wikipedia Web Crawlin'

_All links lead to Rome? More like all links lead to Philosophy_

# Project Overview

There's this weird phenomenon on the web which you may be already familiar with, especially if you browse Wikipedia a little too much. 

If you begin browsing any random Wikipedia page and click the first link on each page which leads to the next, after a couple of clicks, you will find yourself on the "Philosophy" page. As of 2016, 97% of pages invariably lead to "Philosophy". 

Don't believe me yet? Check [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) out.

This is a simple project which crawls any page you may wanna use and collects information from the pages crawled, hence, web crawler.
